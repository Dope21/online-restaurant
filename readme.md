# Restaurant-Management

A Point of Sale (POS) web application for order management comes with a Bootstrap website to support online orders from customers.

This is the graduation project for my Diploma of Vocational Education. While building this project, I learned how to design Data Flow Diagram and ER Diagram for my project, design the UI using Figma, and work with Relational Databases efficiently using SQL statements. 

## Stack

- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Only using this to built the restaurant website

- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - An extension to CSS which adds nested rules, variables, selector, etc.
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) - A scripting language that uses for communicating with the Database.
